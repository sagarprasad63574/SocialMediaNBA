# SocialMediaPokemon

## Overview
This is a static website that allows users to simulate a pokemon battle with teams that they create.
Users are allowed to update their profiles, create their own teams, query the Pokemon API to obtain a pokemon, or create their own pokemon.
With these teams, users are allowed to comment and rate on teams that are posted to the homepage. A user can also view all the comments that they have posted underneath the posted teams.
Users can pit two teams against each other in battle.
